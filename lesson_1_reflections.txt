How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

    It shows mistakes that we created or may be forgot to write and so helps in locating bugs.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    We can easily comapare and check for our mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Sometimes when we write very large codes then it is very diffcult to find out mistakes and having it done automatically is a gift for a coder.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    So that we can use diff files at a single time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log is used to show commits and git diff is used to show difference between two versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Beacuse even if i did break something i can revert it back to normal.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Every thing.
