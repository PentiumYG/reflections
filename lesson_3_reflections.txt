When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
    When i want all my work saved and whenever I wish to work I can work on.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	This is so because sometime i dont want changes to be uploaded from git instead i might be working on some new version.So that whenever we like we can push or pull and not in middle of something.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork is copying from git to git , clone is from git to local and branch is to add some other file in the same one i.e. a branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

   We can merge it later on.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
